# This repository serves as a demonstration of how some common design patterns are implemented in TypeScript

## Creational Patterns

- Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder: Allows constructing complex objects step by step.

## Structural Patterns

- Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- Decorator: Adds new functionalities to an object dynamically.

## Behavioral Patterns

- Observer: Allows a subject to notify its observers when its state changes.
- Strategy: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.
- Command: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
- Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
